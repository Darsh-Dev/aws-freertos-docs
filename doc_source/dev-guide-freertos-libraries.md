# Amazon FreeRTOS Libraries<a name="dev-guide-freertos-libraries"></a>

Amazon FreeRTOS libraries provide additional functionality to the FreeRTOS kernel and its internal libraries\. You can use Amazon FreeRTOS libraries for networking and security in embedded applications\. Amazon FreeRTOS libraries also enable your applications to interact with AWS IoT services\.

The `lib` directory contains the source code of the Amazon FreeRTOS libraries\. There are helper functions that assist in implementing the library functionality\. We do not recommend that you change these helper functions\. If you need to change one of these libraries, make sure it conforms to the library interface defined in the `lib/include` directory\.

## Amazon FreeRTOS Porting Libraries<a name="dev-guide-freertos-porting-libraries"></a>

The following porting libraries are included in configurations of Amazon FreeRTOS that are available for download on the Amazon FreeRTOS console\. These libraries are platform\-dependent\. Their contents change according to your hardware platform\.
