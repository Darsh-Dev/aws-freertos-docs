# Porting Your Device<a name="porting-guide"></a>

Before you can port the Amazon FreeRTOS libraries, you need to port the FreeRTOS kernel to your device\. For information about porting the FreeRTOS kernel, see [FreeRTOS Kernel Porting Guide](http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-porting-guide.html)\.

For information about porting and testing Amazon FreeRTOS libraries for qualification, see the [Amazon FreeRTOS Qualification Developer Guide](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tests/Amazon%20FreeRTOS%20Qualification%20Developer%20Guide.pdf)\.
