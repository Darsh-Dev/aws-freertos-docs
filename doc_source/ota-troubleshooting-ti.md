# Troubleshooting OTA Updates with the Texas Instruments CC3220SF Launchpad<a name="ota-troubleshooting-ti"></a>

The CC3220SF Launchpad platform provides a software tamper detection mechanism that uses a security\-alert counter that is incremented whenever there is an integrity violation\. The device is locked when the security\-alert counter reaches a pre\-determined threshold \(the default is 15\) and the host receives the asynchronous event `SL_ERROR_DEVICE_LOCKED_SECURITY_ALERT`\. The locked device will then have limited accessibility\. To recover the device, you can reprogram it or use the “restore\-to\-factory” process to revert to the factory image\. You should program the desired behavior by updating the asynchronous event handler in “network\_if\.c”\.
